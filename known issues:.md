known issues:
Porrly implemented anchor navigation -one such example is the default Google search result page. 
They seemed to have removed pages in favour of infinite scrollling - loading, but after loading they simply plug a "#-p1" into the url navigation...
Event though there is only one page now, so the navigation doesn't know where "#-p1" starts....
